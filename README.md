This repo was created with the express intent of 
Use anything to your hearts content, but please not that I've utilized the work of three individuals, whose work is credited below
(and you'll presumably want to do the same):
1. dataraw/characters.json: Credited to [Jeffrey Lancaster](jeffrey.lancaster@gmail.com) who compiled a [large array](https://github.com/jeffreylancaster/game-of-thrones)
of publically available GoT datasets and produced far superior GoT visualizations.
2. character-predictions.csv: The team at [A Song Ice and Data](https://got.show/) produced this [dataset](https://data.world/data-society/game-of-thrones), which provides several
simple demographic data related to the characters not seen elsewhere, but perhaps more interestingly a predicted survival score for living character in ASOIAF
3. familytreemaker.py: Adrien Verge produced the [original family tree](https://github.com/adrienverge/familytreemaker) plotting script, which I've altered only very slightly 
to skirt by some UTF-8 issues that pop up on some platforms.
